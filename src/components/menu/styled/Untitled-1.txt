Ideas
-------------------------------------------

New type of input for choosing a value out of a list
  - Established way of doing it?
    Currently almost all sites and apps allow to select a value from a list with
    a vertical dropdown if it are many values or radiobuttons if the options are limited

  - Problems we try to solve?
    With the vertical dropdown there is the issue that it runs out of space quickly and then
    we need things like scrolling and searching to manage it. This leads to more steps for
    the user to make his decision.
    The radiobuttons are kind of okay but it makes it inconsistent for many or few options

  - Goals?
    - We want a unified way to select a value from a list. No difference between a few or many
    values.
    - We want the user to have to make as few steps as possible to select the value
    - Way of least resistance (make it as easy as possible for the user)
    - Visually pleasing solution
  

Concept 1
--------------------------

Variation of a dropdown list but instead of dropping down under the placeholder we drop 'over' the placeholder.

Dropdown:

The dropdown is in close position 1 itemheight long. When opened it is 4 itemheights long (items + 1 for placeholder)
All of this extra height of 3 is going in 1 direction (down) stressing the ui thats under the dropdown.
The user will have to move at least 1 itemheight and at most 3 itemheights

  closed:                         open:
  +--------------------+          +--------------------+          
  |    placeholder     |          |    placeholder     |
  +--------------------+          +--------------------+
                                  |       item 1       |
                                  |       item 2       |
                                  |       item 3       |
                                  +--------------------+

Dropover:

The dropover is in closed position 1 itemheight long. When opened it is 3 itemheights long (items, placeholder is covered)
All of this extra height is going in 2 directions (up and down) spreading the extra stress over multiple places.
The user will have to move at least 0 itemheights and at most 1 itemheight

  closed:                         open:
  
                                  +--------------------+
  +--------------------+          |       item 1       |
  |    placeholder     |          |       item 2       |
  +--------------------+          |       item 3       |
                                  +--------------------+
